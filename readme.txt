PathExplorer
==========


Before running this, the user has generated a PathMapper Output: 
- an SVG as a background image (e.g., pathway diagram) generated by PathMapper
- a dictionary of {Phosphosite : cartesian coords}


At runtime, the user supplies a valid PathMapper Output, and a dataset CSV (e.g., proteomics run) with columns [Phosphosite, Value1, …, Value(n)]


PathExplorer returns:


An interactive chart layout based on d3.js, crossfilter.js, and dc.js


The top span is a d3 bubble overlay chart with a bubble for each phosphosite, at positions in dictionary


Beneath that are histogram charts for each dimansion
